<div class="para">In order to talk about the location of stones on the board, it is helpful to have a notation for the intersections.  To do this we number the rows from bottom to top, and we use letters (starting with A and skipping I) across the bottom. <div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/sec-rules-of-the-game-5-2-1-1.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A 19 by 19 board with rows and columns labeled."></div> The nine small dots on the board are called <em class="emphasis">star points</em>.   They are simply there as reference points. We reference intersections by listing the letter first followed by the number. For example, the white stone is at the D8 point.  The black stone is at the M17 point. The center star point, at K10, is sometimes referred to by its Japanese name <em class="emphasis">tengen</em>.   The corner star points are called 4-4 points (four lines from the two nearest sides), but if we want to name a specific 4-4 point we can use the label D4, D16, Q4, or Q16.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-rules-of-the-game.html#sec-rules-of-the-game-5">in-context</a></span>
