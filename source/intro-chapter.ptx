  <title>What is Go?</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Go is a game.  </p> 
    
    <p>Go is the oldest game in the world, with evidence of it being 
      played for thousands of years in China, where it is called Weichi (the surrounding 
      game).  The game reached Korea in the 5th century,
      where it is called Baduk.  The game reached Japan in the 7th century, where it 
      is called Go (or Igo).  From its earliest incarnations, Go was considered a
      worthy activity for aristocrats
      and scholars.  In Japan, the first system of professional Go players was developed starting
      in the 14th century.  The game only reached the western world in the 19th century.  </p>
      
    <p>Go is a game of complete information and pure strategy. </p>
