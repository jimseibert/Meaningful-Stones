    <section>  <title>  Introduction </title>
    <p>Go is the oldest game in the world, with evidence of it being 
      played for thousands of years in China.
      
    </p>
    
   
    <p>  In China the game is called Weichi - the surrounding 
      game.  The game reached Korea in (about) the 5th century CE,
      where it is called Baduk.  The game reached Japan in (about) the 7th century, where it 
      is called Go (or Igo). The game only reached the western world in the 19th century. 
       </p>
      
    <p>Go is a game of complete information.  The games are decided by the local tactics
      and global strategies of the players. There is no randomness.</p>

    <p>
      From its earliest incarnations, Go was considered a
      worthy activity for aristocrats, scholars, and military leaders.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Go is a simple game with few rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Go is a complex game with more possible outcomes than there are atoms in the known universe!
