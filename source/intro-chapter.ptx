  <title>What is Go?</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Go is a game.  </p> 
    
    <p>Go is the oldest game in the world, with evidence of it being 
      played for thousands of years in China, where it is called Weichi - the surrounding 
      game.  The game reached Korea in (about) the 5th century CE,
      where it is called Baduk.  The game reached Japan in (about) the 7th century, where it 
      is called Go (or Igo). The game only reached the western world in the 19th century. 
      From its earliest incarnations, Go was considered a
      worthy activity for aristocrats
      and scholars. </p>
      
    <p>Go is a game of complete information, and the games are decided by the local tactics
      and global strategies of the players. </p>
