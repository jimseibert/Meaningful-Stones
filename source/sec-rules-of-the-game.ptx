  <title>Rules of the Game of Go</title>

  <p> There are very few rules in the game of go.  

  <ol> 
    <li>  Rule 1:  One player has white stones and the other player has black stones.  
      To begin black places one stone on any intersection on a grid.
      Players then alternate playing one stone each on any intersection of the grid.  
      The grid is usually 19 <times/> 19, but the game can be played 
      on 9 <times/> 9 or 13 <times/> 13 boards as well.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 2:  Surround your opponent's stones to capture them.  Captured stones are 
      removed from the board and kept by the capturing player.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 3:  The player whose stones surround the most territory 
      in the end wins the game.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 4:  Placing a stone that results in self-capture is not allowed.  </li>
    
    <li>  Rule 5:  Repetition of an identical board position is not allowed 
      (the <em>ko</em> rule). </li>

    </ol>
