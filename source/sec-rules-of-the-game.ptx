  <title>Rules of the Game of Go</title>

  <p> There are very few rules in the game of go.  

    <ul> 
      <li>  Rule 1:  One player has white stones and the other player has black stones.  
        To begin black places one stone on any intersection on a grid.
        Players then alternate playing one stone each on any intersection of the grid.  
        The grid is usually 19 <times/> 19, but the game can be played 
        on boards of other sizes.  Boards of 9 <times/> 9 or 13 <times/> 13 are 
        common for beginners.  </li>
  
      <li>  Rule 2:  Surround your opponent's stones to capture them.  Captured stones are 
        removed from the board and kept by the capturing player.  </li>
  
      <li>  Rule 3:  The player with the most territory plus captures wins the game.
        The game ends when both players decide there are no more moves remaining that will
        increase their territory or reduce their opponent's territory, capture opponent's 
        stones or protect their own stones from capture.  Territory is then counted as 
        the number of open intersections surrounded by one player's stones.  </li>
  
      <li>  Rule 4:  Placing a stone that results in self-capture is not allowed.  </li>
      
      <li>  Rule 5:  Repetition of an identical board position is not allowed 
        (the <em>ko</em> rule). </li>
  
      </ul>
  
      The video below introduces these rules in more detail.  Watch the video 
      and work through the examples to test your understanding.

        <title>Goups of stones</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Recall that stones that are next to each other along horizontal or vertical lines
            (but NOT diagonally)
            are connected and form a single <em>group</em>.  In the following figure, how
            many black groups are there?  How many white groups?

            Remember that spaces next to a group of stones (along horizontal or vertical lines)
            are called the <em>liberties</em> of the group.  
            There are two groups in the figure below.  How many liberties does each have?

            In order to talk about the location of stones on the board, it is helpful to have 
            a notation for the intersections.  To do this we number the rows from bottom to 
            top, and we use letters (starting with A and skipping I) across the bottom.  </p>

         <p> The nine small dots on the board are called <em>star points</em>.  <idx>star points</idx>
          They are simply there as reference points.  
          We reference intersections by listing the letter first followed by the number.
          For example, the white stone is at the D8 point.  The black stone is at the M17 point. 
          The center star point, at K10, is sometimes referred to by its Japanese
          name <em>tengen</em>. <idx>tengen</idx>  The corner star points are called 4-4 points (four
          lines from the two nearest sides), but if we want to name a specific 4-4 point we 
          can use the label D4, D16, Q4, or Q16.

           <p> Why is the game completed?  Neither side has any meaningful moves remaining.
            (Meaningful moves either increase your territory or reduce your opponent's territory, 
            threaten to capture stones or protect your stones from being captured.)
            You might ask, "Why doesn't black play at B1?"  Well, white will immediately
            play at B2, capturing the black stone.  The end result is that white's territory
            is reduced by one since they placed an extra stone inside their own territory, but 
            they increase their captures by one, resulting in no change to their overal score
            (territory plus captures).  In general, there is no benefit to placing stones 
            in your opponent's territory unless you have an opportunity to capture some
            stones.      
          </p>

            <p>
              Black has 14 points (11 points of territory and 3 captures), while white has 
              9 points (five points of territory and four captures).  Black wins by five
              points.

          <solution>
            <p>
              In online games, the computer will calculate the score for you, of course.  
              For in-person games, counting the score by hand is done by each player filling their
              opponents' territory with their captures and then counting the remaining territory.
      
              In this example, using captured stones to fill territory might look like 
              the following.   </p>

          <p>  Black cannot immediately recapture with a move at D4 (the 
            star point) because of the ko rule.  
          </p>
      
          <p>  Black must play somewhere else on the board. Suppose black plays at F3, extending
            their weak stone.  White now has a choice.  White can play elsewhere on the board,
            or they can play at D4 ending the "ko fight."  </p>

          <p>  Here white has ended the ko.  White is left with an inefficient clump of stones, but they 
          have lots of liberties and are not in immediate danger.
      
          </p>
      
          <p>  
          Here's a more complicated example of a ko.  As before, white has just taken the 
          stone at D4 to start the ko.  This time black has a better move, the marked stone at G3.
          This kind of move is called a "ko threat."  It threatens to take something more
          valuable than the ko, forcing your opponent to respond away from the ko and allowing
          you to retake the ko.  </p>
      
          <image  width="50%">
            <shortdescription> Black C2, C3, D2, E3, F1, F2, F3, G1, J2, K1, K2, G3;  White C4, E4, D3, D5, G2, H1, H2, J1, G4, H4.</shortdescription>

        <p>  In this case black is threatening the four white stones.  White has to choose between
          saving the four white stones and ending the ko.  If white saves the four stones, then 
          black can re-take the ko with a stone at D4.    </p>
          
          <image  width="50%">
            <shortdescription> Same as previous with White H3 added, and Black captures at D4.</shortdescription>

        <p>  Now it's white's turn to look for a ko threat somewhere else on the board.  If they 
          can force black to respond elsewhere, then white can re-take the ko.  If they can't  
          find a ko threat, then black can play at D3 ending the ko.
      
          This process of taking turns looking for ko threats and retaking the ko is called a 
          ko fight.  It is a natural consequence of the ko rule.
