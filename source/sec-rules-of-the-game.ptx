  <title>Rules of the Game of Go</title>

  <p> There are very few rules in the game of go.  

  <ol> 
    <li>  Rule 1:  One player has white stones and the other player has black stones.  
      To begin black places one stone on any intersection on a grid.
      Players then alternate playing one stone each on any intersection of the grid.  
      The grid is usually 19 <times/> 19, but the game can be played 
      on boards of other sizes.  Boards of 9 <times/> 9 or 13 <times/> 13 are 
      common for beginners.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 2:  Surround your opponent's stones to capture them.  Captured stones are 
      removed from the board and kept by the capturing player.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 3:  The player with the most territory plus captures wins the game.
      The game ends when both players decide there are no more moves remaining that will
      increase their territory or reduce their opponent's territory, capture opponent's 
      stones or protect their own stones from capture.  Territory is then counted as 
      the number of open intersections surrounded by one player's stones.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 4:  Placing a stone that results in self-capture is not allowed.  </li>
    
    <li>  Rule 5:  Repetition of an identical board position is not allowed 
      (the <em>ko</em> rule). </li>

    </ol>

    The video below introduces these rules in more detail.  Watch the video 
    and work through the examples to test your understanding.

  <title>Goups of stones</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Recall that stones that are next to each other along horizontal or vertical lines
      (but NOT diagonally)
      are connected and form a single <em>group</em>.  In the following figure, how
      many black groups are there?  How many white groups?

      There are three black groups (one group marked with triangles, one marked with squares,
      and one marked with circles) and two white groups (one marked with crosses and 
      the other with unmarked stones).

  <title>Counting liberties</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Remember that spaces next to a group of stones (along horizontal or vertical lines)
      are called the <em>liberties</em> of the group.  
      There are two groups in the figure below.  How many liberties does each have?

  <title>Locations on the Board</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      In order to talk about the location of stones on the board, it is helpful to have 
      a notation for the intersections.  To do this we number the rows from bottom to 
      top, and we use letters (starting with A and skipping I) across the bottom.

    The nine small dots on the board are called <em>star points</em>.  <idx>star points</idx>
    They are simply there as reference points.  
    We reference intersections by listing the letter first followed by the number.
    For example, the white stone is at the D8 point.  The black stone is at the M17 point. 
    The center star point, at K10, is sometimes referred to by its Japanese
    name <em>tengen</em>. <idx>tengen</idx>  The corner star points are called 4-4 points (four
    lines from the two nearest sides), but if we want to name a specific 4-4 point we 
    can use the label D4, D16, Q4, or Q16.

  <title>Counting the Score</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a gmae that has finished on a 7 <times/> 7 board. 

        <image  width="50%">
            <description>A completed 7x7 game.</description>
            <latex-image>
              \cleargoban
              \gobansize{7}
              \black{d1,e1,g1,e2,g2,f3,d3,d4,e4,f4,g4,d5,c4,a5,b5,d6,d7}
              \white{a1,c1,a2,c2,d2,b3,c3,a4,b4,e5,f5,g5,e6,g6,e7,f7}
              \showgoban

      Why is the game completed?  Neither side has any meaningful moves remaining.
      (Meaningful moves either increase your territory or reduce your opponent's territory, 
      threaten to capture stones or protect your stones from being captured.)
      You might ask, "Why doesn't black play at B1?"  Well, white will immediately
      play at B2, capturing the black stone.  The end result is that white's territory
      is reduced by one since they placed an extra stone inside their own territory, but 
      they increase their captures by one, resulting in no change to their overal score
      (territory plus captures).  In general, there is no benefit to placing stones 
      in your opponent's territory unless you have an opportunity to capture some
      stones.      
    </p>

    <p>  Suppose that white
      has captured 4 black stones and black has captured 3 white stones.  What is 
      the final score of the game?  
    </p>
  </statement>

    <answer>
      <p>
        Black has 14 points (11 points of territory and 3 captures), while white has 
        9 points (five points of territory and four captures).  Black wins by five
        points.
      </p>
    </answer>

    <solution>
      <p>
        In online games, the computer will calculate the score for you, of course.  
        For in-person games, counting the score by hand is done by first filling your
        opponent's territory with your captures and then counting the remaining territory.

        In this example, using captured stones to fill territory might look like 
        the following.

        <image  width="50%">
          <description>A completed 7x7 game, with territory filled by captures.</description>
          <latex-image>
            \cleargoban
            \gobansize{7}
            \black{d1,e1,g1,e2,g2,f3,d3,d4,e4,f4,g4,d5,c4,a5,b5,d6,d7,e3,f1,f2,g3}
            \white{a1,c1,a2,c2,d2,b3,c3,a4,b4,e5,f5,g5,e6,g6,e7,f7,a3,b1,b2}
            \showgoban
          </latex-image>
      </image>

      After the captures have been placed, black now has 7 points of territory and 
      white has two.  The final scores have changed but the difference is the same.
      Black still wins by five.
