  <title>Rules of the Game of Go</title>

  <p> There are very few rules in the game of go.  

  <ol> 
    <li>  Rule 1:  One player has white stones and the other player has black stones.  
      To begin black places one stone on any intersection on a grid.
      Players then alternate playing one stone each on any intersection of the grid.  
      The grid is usually 19 <times/> 19, but the game can be played 
      on 9 <times/> 9 or 13 <times/> 13 boards as well.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 2:  Surround your opponent's stones to capture them.  Captured stones are 
      removed from the board and kept by the capturing player.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 3:  The player whose stones surround the most territory 
      in the end wins the game.  </li>

    <li>  Rule 4:  Placing a stone that results in self-capture is not allowed.  </li>
    
    <li>  Rule 5:  Repetition of an identical board position is not allowed 
      (the <em>ko</em> rule). </li>

    </ol>

    The video below introduces these rules in more detail.  Watch the video 
    and work through the examples to test your understanding.

  <title>Goups of stones</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Recall that stones that are next to each other along horizontal or vertical lines
      (but NOT diagonally)
      are connected and form a single <em>group</em>.  In the following figure, how
      many black groups are there?  How many white groups?

      There are three black groups (one group marked with triangles, one marked with squares,
      and one marked with circles) and two white groups (one marked with crosses and 
      the other with unmarked stones).

  <title>Counting liberties</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Remember that spaces next to a group of stones (along horizontal or vertical lines)
      are called the <em>liberties</em> of the group.  
      There are two groups in the figure below.  How many liberties does each have?

      <image  width="50%">
        <description>One black group and one white group of stones.</description>

          \showgoban
        </latex-image>

    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      The black group has seven liberties, and the white group has ten.
    </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Here the liberties are marked.
