  <p>  When playing your first few games, the number of possibilities available seems overwhelming.  Which moves are good?  Which moves are bad?  How can we decide?
    To help narrow down the possibilities it helps to become familiar with some common shapes that appear in games of Go.  You will often hear Go players talk about "making good shape."
    The first concept to understand is how to efficiently build shapes while keeping your stones connected.  Once again, we turn to Michael Redmond for the basics.

 <p>  The video covered solid connections, diagonal connections, and the one-space jump.
    There are even more efficient ways to expand, but they are riskier.  Perhaps the most common is the knight's move.  The knight's move is two steps in one direction and
    one step in another, like a knight moves in chess.
    It stretches a little farther than a one-space jump
    but it is easier for your opponent to separate, or cut, the two stones. 
 </p>

<p> Here's one possible sequence that shows how white can cut the black knight's move into two separate groups. </p>

<image  width="50%">

    </latex-image>
  </image>

<p>
    Unless black can capture one of white's cutting stones, the two black groups will remain separated.  Of course, the two white stones are also cut, so what we really have here
    is the start of a fight!  Black has to be aware of this possiblity, and white will have to evaluate whether the fight helps them before attempting the cut.  
    The knight's move is especially strong near the edges of the board, where one of the 
    cutting stones will be in danger of being run into the edge of the board and captured.  
</p>

<p>
    The diagonal jump is another loose connection, stretching a bit farther and a little easier to cut.  The diagonal jump is called <em>hazama tobi</em> in Japanese,
    and is sometimes called the elephant jump because it reflects how the elephant piece moves in Chinese chess.
</p>

  </image>

<p>
    You can see how white could keep these two black stones from connecting by placing a stone right in the middle.  This will, of course, lead to a complicated fight!
</p>

<p>
    Jumping any farther than this is too loose to consider a true connection, but instead form larger structures that outline potential territories.  Moves like 
    a two-space or three-space jump are usually referred to as extensions.  The large knight's move shown here is another extension usually only played near the edge
    of the board.

      <p>
        The diamond shape shown here is called a "ponnuki," the Japanese term for bloom, and is a very powerful shape.  There is a Go proverb that says "A ponnuki is worth 30 
        points."  
      </p>
    
      <image  width="50%">

        </latex-image>
      </image>
      
<p>
    A ponnuki radiates power in all directions, and is very hard to attack.  It creates one space on the board (right in the middle) 
    that it is illegal for your opponent to play (unless capturing).
    It is progress toward creating a shape called an eye, which we will see is a very important concept.
</p>

<p>
    A rough definition of an eye is that it is an empty space surrrounded by stones of one color (like a ponnuki) that can be connected into a chain of solidly connected
    stones surrounding the empty point.  The following example shows that a group with one eye can be captured.
</p>

            The following board shows a black group with one eye.  What would white have to do to capture this group?

<answer>
    <p>
        White cannot place a stone in the middle unless they are capturing, so they first have to fill all of the outside liberties.  Once they do, however, the black stones will
        be in atari, black cannot place in the middle (an illegal self-capture), so white can place in the middle and capture the whole black group.

    <p>
        The rules of Go say nothing about eyes, but an important consequence of the rules is that a group with two eyes cannot be captured.  A group with two eyes 
        is said to be <em>alive</em>.  A group that can be reduced to one eye (or no eyes) can be captured eventually and is said to be <em>dead</em>.  The following example examines a 
        group with two eyes.

    <answer>
        <p>
            White cannot place a stone in either of the empty spaces in black's group (illegal self-captures), but white has to fill both of those liberties to capture the 
            black stones!  The black group is alive and permanently safe.
        </p>
    </answer>
</example>

<p>
    It is worth saying again.  This is a surprising consequence of the rules.  The rules say nothing about eyes, but the need for a group to have two eyes emerges as 
    perhaps the most important concept in Go!  If you cannot give a group of stones two eyes, then that group of stones will be (eventually) captured.  Making shapes
    with two-eyes is an extremely important skill!

        Shapes are generally called "good" when they can easily be made into eyes, or when they form a solid connection.  Here we outline some commonly occurring good shapes.  If you
        make these shapes in your games, you are doing well!

        <p>
            The following black stones form what is called the mouth shape.  The mouth shape is an efficient arrangement of stones that virtually guarantees a group with

<subsection xml:id="subsec-bad-shapes">
    <title>Some Bad Shapes</title>
    
    <p>
        Bad shapes are shapes that are very inefficient at creating eyes.  Big clumps of stones with no eyes, sometimes called dumplings, are obviously bad.
        The following example shows a clump that might naturally arise in a game.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>The B-52 Bomber</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the following board situation.  Black was trying to attack the white stones, but has left cutting points at A and B, and should to try to protect
          one or the other.  
        </p>

        <image  width="50%">
          <shortdescription>Black C5, D4, E3, E2; White B4, C4, C3, D3, D2; A at D5, B at E4</shortdescription>

          </latex-image>
        </image>

        <p>
          What will happen if black tries to protect both cutting points with a move at E5 (marked with an x)?
        </p>
      </statement>

        <answer>
          <p>
            One possible sequence might look like this.  Do you see the B-52 bomber shape?
          </p>

          <image  width="50%">
            <shortdescription>Black C5, D4, E3, E2; White B4, C4, C3, D3, D2; </shortdescription>

            </latex-image>
          </image>

          <p> I've also heard Black's shape called the "big stupid triangle" in this situation.  Black has a big clump of stones that are not surrounding any territory.  
          They are not making any space for eyes to form.  They are just inefficiently placed stones.  When this is the result, it is safe to say that Black probably 
          should have played otherwise earlier on.  In this case, trying to fix both cuts with one move at E5 was a mistake.
          </p>
        </answer>

    
    
    </example>

<p>
  Another, perhaps more subtle, example of bad shape is what is called the "empty triangle."  Strong players try to avoid making empty triangles if they can.
</p>

<example>
  <title>The Empty Triangle</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Recall that one good way to make a connection is with a diagonal move.
    </p>

    <image  width="50%">
      <shortdescription>Black F7, G8</shortdescription>
      <latex-image>
        \cleargoban
        \black{f7,g8}
        \showgoban
      </latex-image>
    </image>
    <p>
      If White tries to cut on either side, then Black can play the other point to strongly connect the two stones.
    </p>
    <image  width="50%">
      <shortdescription>Black F7, G8, G7; White F8</shortdescription>
      <latex-image>

        \white{f8}
        \showgoban
      </latex-image>
    </image>
    <p>
      Here the black stones are forming a triangle that is filled in by the white stone.  This is natural and good!  White forced black to make the triangle by threatening
      to cut.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If Black makes that triangle shape without the white stone there, that is what is called an empty triangle.  Black has wasted a move by fixing the cut before White
      even threatened it.  In most cases, Black would rather have the diagonal connection without the triangle.  Making the empty triangle is another inefficient shape.
    </p>
    <p>(Sometimes making an empty triangle is the best move in a 
      given situation.  Whenever you see yourself about to make an empty triangle, though, you should look to see if there are better options!)

<p>
  The final example more about tactics than specifically about shape.  There is a Go proverb, "Don't attach to a weak stone."
  The reason for this is that doing so generally makes the opponent's weak stone stronger, and gives them an advantage over your attaching stone.
</p>

<example>
  <title>Attaching to a Weak Stone</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Here we see that White has attached to a weak Black stone.  Think of this as a capturing race between the two stones.  When White attached, that 
      reduced Black's liberties by one (from four to three).  However, the White stone also has reduced their own liberties!  Both stones have three liberties,
      and it is Black's turn.  Black has the advantage in that capturing race.
    </p>

    <image  width="50%">
      <shortdescription>Black F3; White G3</shortdescription>

        \black{f3}

      </latex-image>
      </image>

      <p>
        Even if Black doesn't try to take up White's liberties right away, Black can extend their stone, increasing the liberty count of the Black group.
      </p>

      <image  width="50%">
        <shortdescription>Black F3; White G3</shortdescription>

        </latex-image>
        </image>
        <p>
          If the Black stone was weak before, it certainly looks stronger now.  All White has accomplished is strengthening their opponent's stone!
        </p>

        <p>
          In general, if you want to attack a weak stone, it is much better to build a loose net around it, hopefully while building up potential territory for yourself
          on the other side of the stones that you play.

  <p>
    Now that we know about living and dead groups, and the importance of having two eyes, we can look at some common shapes and decide if they are alive or dead.
    A group that has two eyes is alive.  A group that can be reduced to one (or fewer) eyes is dead.
  </p>

  <answer>
    <idx><h>vital point</h></idx>
    <p>
      A <em>vital point</em> in a shape is a point that determines the life or death of the shape.  If Black plays the vital point, the shape dies.  If White plays
      the vital point, the shape gains two eyes and unconditionally lives.
      The vital point is the middle of the three spaces.

<p>
  If White plays on either side to atari this stone, it is actually self-atari and Black captures the whole group.
</p>
<p>
  If White plays elsewhere, normally Black would also leave this alone, knowing it is a dead shape.  At the end of the game, both players would agree that 
  the White stones are dead, they would be taken off the board and given to Black as captures.
  </p>
  <p>
    If Black really wants to capture these stones (or needs to in order to prevent something else from being captured), Black can play a second stone inside White's territory
    placing White in atari.

    If White captures again, White has created a one space territory completely surrounded by Black.  White is in atari and will be captured on the next move.

      It doesn't matter whether the three spaces are in a row (as shown) or bent.  The same logic applies, and the middle point is the vital point.  The life and death of the 
      group is determined by who plays the vital point.
    </p>

  <p>
    If White is allowed to play on the vital middle point, then White has a two-eye, living group.  White is unconditionally alive.

  If a three-space group is dead, what about a four-space group?  The answer is that it depends!  If the four spaces form a squareor a T-shape, Black can kill the groups.
  Any other arrangement of four spaces is generally alive.  (There are some exceptions, but they are 
  complicated and rare.)

      When four spaces are not in a square or a T shape, there is no way for Black to prevent white from dividing the territory into two eyes.
